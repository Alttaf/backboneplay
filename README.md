# backboneplay

This is my first real attempt at writing a basic app in backbone.  It implemeents four basic views, using backbone boiler plate to get the routing and other basics off the ground.
Coming from an angular background the freedom bootstrap gives was quite liberating, but also a massive hindrence when trying to get basic tasks done as I was a compleet noob.

<h1> WHat went well</h1>
I like the routing on backbone really easy with the vm module and is quite logical in its structure.  I tried to keep the views away from changing any logic by using models and collections
however sometimes the views freely manipulating the dom and then rendering a template could be a bit confusing.  

<h1> Even Better if</h1>
I could get the call to the show stores api to stop restarting the whole view.  I haven't mastered the url management and I think my form parameters are confusing the router
and forcing a re initialisation each time.  

I will probably update this once I get this working as it is bugging me LOL
